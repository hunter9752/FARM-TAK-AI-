# NLP Requirements for Farmer Intent Detection
# These are in addition to STT requirements

# Core NLP dependencies (already covered by STT)
# numpy>=1.21.0
# No additional heavy dependencies needed

# Optional for advanced features
# spacy>=3.4.0  # For advanced NLP (uncomment if needed)
# transformers>=4.20.0  # For BERT-based models (uncomment if needed)
# scikit-learn>=1.1.0  # For ML-based classification (uncomment if needed)

# The current implementation uses lightweight regex and rule-based NLP
# which doesn't require additional dependencies beyond Python standard library
